This is a portfolio of my work in the MS Data Analysis (MSDA) degree program at Western Governors University.
I completed my education to make a career change into data analytics following a career in Speech-Language Pathology. 
This portfolio showcases my work for prospective employers, while also providing useful resources for other students following behind me in those programs. 
I benefitted tremendously from the tips and advice of prior students throughout my educational journey, and this is a part of my ongoing issue to return 
the favor and ensure more people get the help they need to also complete this degree. 

This degree focused on 11 courses: 

D204: The Data Analytics Journey
The Data Analytics Journey gives an overview of the entire analytics life cycle. Learners gain fluency in data analytics
terminology, tools, and techniques. The course contextualizes the data analytics journey firmly with organizational metrics
and requirements to position graduates to answer key questions for businesses and other employers. This course has no
prerequisites.
This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate explains the phases of the data analytics life cycle to contextualize and define the scope of each phase.
● The graduate develops a project plan to solve organizational problems.
● The graduate determines organizational requirements to improve key drivers.
● The graduate identifies appropriate data analytics tools and techniques to solve organizational problems.

D205: Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning continues building proficiency in the data analytics life cycle with data preparation skills. This course
addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Learners write code to manipulate,
structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets. The following courses are prerequisites: The Data
Analytics Journey, and Data Acquisition.

This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate predicts potential obstacles in data analysis based on the quality of data provided.
● The graduate prepares data for analysis to address organizational needs.
● The graduate writes reusable code to manipulate and clean data in preparation for analysis.

D207: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis covers statistical principles supporting the data analytics life cycle. Students in this course
compute and interpret measures of central tendency, correlations, and variation. The course introduces hypothesis testing,
focusing on application for parametric tests, and addresses communication skills and tools to explain an analyst’s findings to
others within an organization. Data Cleaning is a required prerequisite for this course.

This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate interprets central tendency, correlations, and variation to inform organizational decisions.
● The graduate conducts parametric hypothesis testing.

D208: Predictive Modeling
Predictive Modeling builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling students to make assertions vital to
organizational needs. In this course, students conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena
revealed by data. The course covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing students to communicate
findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders. Exploratory Data Analysis is a prerequisite
for this course.

This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate employs logistic regression algorithms to describe phenomena.
● The graduate employs multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing
phenomena.
● The graduate makes assertions based on regression modeling.

D209: Advanced Data Analytics
Advanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides
emerging concepts in data analysis. This course hones the mental and theoretical flexibility that will be required of analysts
in the coming decades while grounding their approach firmly in ethical and organizational-need-focused practice. Topics
include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources. Data Mining II is a prerequisite
for this course.

This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.
● The graduate applies time series models in generating forecasts.
● The graduate extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models.

Data Management
Data Acquisition
Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle.
The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation.
There are no prerequisites.
This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
● The graduate implements physical data models.
● The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.
