This is a portfolio of my work in the MS Data Analysis (MSDA) degree program at Western Governors University.
I completed my education to make a career change into data analytics following a career in Speech-Language Pathology. 
This portfolio showcases my work for prospective employers, while also providing useful resources for other students following behind me in those programs. 
I benefitted tremendously from the tips and advice of prior students throughout my educational journey, and this is a part of my ongoing issue to return 
the favor and ensure more people get the help they need to also complete this degree.

D208: Predictive Modeling

Predictive Modeling builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling students to make assertions vital to
organizational needs. In this course, students conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena
revealed by data. The course covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing students to communicate
findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders. Exploratory Data Analysis is a prerequisite
for this course.

This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate employs logistic regression algorithms to describe phenomena.
● The graduate employs multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing
phenomena.
● The graduate makes assertions based on regression modeling.


D209: Advanced Data Analytics

Advanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides
emerging concepts in data analysis. This course hones the mental and theoretical flexibility that will be required of analysts
in the coming decades while grounding their approach firmly in ethical and organizational-need-focused practice. Topics
include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources. Data Mining II is a prerequisite
for this course.

This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.
● The graduate applies time series models in generating forecasts.
● The graduate extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models.

Data Management

D205: Data Acquisition
Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle.
The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation.
There are no prerequisites.
This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
● The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
● The graduate implements physical data models.
● The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.

D211: Advanced Data Acquisition
Advanced Data Acquisition enhances theoretical and SQL skills in furthering the data analytics life cycle. This course covers advanced SQL operations, aggregating data, and acquiring data from various sources in support of core organizational needs. The prerequisite for this course is Representation and Reporting. This course covers the following competencies: 
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together. 
● The graduate applies advanced SQL operations to integrate multiple data sources. 
● The graduate explores data acquisition


Data Mining

D209 Data Mining I & D211: Data Mining II

Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the
data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data
mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The
course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity. D208 Predictive Modeling is a prerequisite to
this course

This course covers the following competencies:
● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.
