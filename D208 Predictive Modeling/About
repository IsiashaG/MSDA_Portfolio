D208 Predictive Modeling
Foucs: Predictive Modeling builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling students to make assertions 
vital to organizational needs. In this course, students conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena 
revealed by data. The course covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing students to communicate 
findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders.
