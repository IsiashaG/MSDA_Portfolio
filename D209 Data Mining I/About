D209: Data Mining I 
Focus: Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the 
data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data 
mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides 
frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity.
